A phase-field model of electrodeposition of Copper in Through Silicon VIAs

Developed a phase-field model in Python utilizing the FEniCS finite element library to investigate the impact of various parameters, including overpotential, additive nature, and additive concentration, on the electrodeposition of copper within Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) in three-dimensional electronic circuit packaging, with a focus on controlling deposition kinetics and minimizing defects such as voids and internal stresses that affect current flow. This model encompassed diffusion of copper cations and additives through the electrolyte, copper cation deposition on the electrode, and the transport of adsorbed additives with the moving interface, employing the Allen-Cahn model for interface motion, Butler-Volmer kinetics for deposition, and a similar physics-based model for additives' behavior. The study aimed to understand how different factors influenced the growth kinetics of planar interfaces and two-dimensional TSVs in high-density packaging.
